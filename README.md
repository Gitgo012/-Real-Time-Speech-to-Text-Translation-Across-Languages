# -Real-Time-Speech-to-Text-Translation-Across-Languages
This project aims to build a **real-time multilingual translation system** that can transcribe and translate speech across different languages during live conversations. The system is particularly useful in domains like global business meetings, tourism, and cross-cultural collaborations.
